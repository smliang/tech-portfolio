Hey! My name is *Sarah Liang*(https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahliangCS), and I am a computer science and mathematics major on an excellerated path to a masters of business administration studying at the University of Alabama. I have a strong background and familiarity with consumer electronics as a lifelong enthusiast of all things technology. After I graduate with my masters in spring 2023, I aspire to be a software developer at a high achieving, innovative company. Some other fun facts about me:

1. My weekly routine revolves around Friday's episode of [The Vergecast](https://www.theverge.com/the-vergecast). Nilay and Dieter are the only two people who can talk about consumer tech more than I can.
1. I have served on the executive council at the Mu Chapter of Theta Tau, which is UA's co-ed professional and social engineering fraternity. This has given me extensive experience in soft-skills, management, and problem solving.
1. I hail from New Orleans, Louisiana (which is obviously the best place on earth). Yes, Mardi Gras is everything you want it to be. And Yes, the food is infinitely superior. 
1. Graphic and motion design is a skill I've self-taught since my high school days. I love logo design, branding, and animation. I've done a few projects for businesses (check out my behance!)(https://wwww.be.net/sarahliang), and even a rebrand for my fraternity! I feel like these skills in design would give me good skills to understand what UI/UX developers are looking for on the front end of a project.
